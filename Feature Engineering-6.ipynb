    "# Q1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "+1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship,\n",
    "-1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and\n",
    "0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time students spend studying and their final exam scores, you'd follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect the data (e.g., hours of study and exam scores).\n",
    "Calculate the sum of the products of the paired values (xy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the result is close to +1, it indicates that as study time increases, the exam scores tend to increase.\n",
    "If the result is close to -1, it suggests an inverse relationship (more study time corresponds to lower scores).\n",
    "A result near 0 implies no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Spearman's Rank Correlation:\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship between two variables. Unlike Pearson, it does not require the data to be linearly related and can capture both increasing and decreasing relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank the data for both variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the difference in ranks for each pair of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Square these differences and sum them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the formula to calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A value close to +1 indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship (as one variable increases, so does the other).\n",
    "A value close to -1 indicates a strong negative monotonic relationship (as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n",
    "A value near 0 indicates no monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlation:\n",
    "To calculate both the Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation for the number of hours of exercise and BMI in a sample of 50 participants, you'd follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson measures the linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "Spearman measures the monotonic relationship, which can be either linear or non-linear but must consistently increase or decrease.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Pearson's correlation by applying the formula mentioned above.\n",
    "Rank the values for both variables and apply the Spearman rank correlation formula.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the two values. If both correlations are similar and close to +1 or -1, then a strong linear or monotonic relationship exists.\n",
    "If Pearson shows a high correlation but Spearman does not (or vice versa), it suggests that there may be a non-monotonic but linear relationship, or a weak monotonic relationship despite a clear linear one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Pearson Correlation for TV Watching vs. Physical Activity:\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours spent watching television and physical activity levels, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect the data (e.g., TV watching hours and physical activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the Pearson formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the result is close to +1, it indicates that more TV watching correlates with more physical activity.\n",
    "If close to -1, more TV watching is linked to less physical activity.\n",
    "A result near 0 suggests no significant linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Survey Data on Age vs. Soft Drink Preference:\n",
    "For the relationship between Age and preference for a brand of soft drink, you would:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather the data on age and soft drink preference (perhaps coded numerically).\n",
    "Use Pearson correlation if you believe there is a linear relationship or Spearman if the relationship may be monotonic but not linear.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson will show if there's a linear correlation between age and preference.\n",
    "Spearman will show if there's a monotonic relationship (whether the relationship is consistent but not necessarily linear).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Pearson Correlation for Sales Calls vs. Sales Made:\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week for 30 sales representatives, you'd:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather the data (sales calls and sales made).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A high positive Pearson value indicates that making more calls correlates with more sales.\n",
    "A value close to 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "A negative value suggests that making more calls could inversely relate to the number of sales made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of Python Output:\n",
    "The output will provide you with the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.\n",
    "Pearson is typically used when you expect a linear relationship, and Spearman is used when you suspect a monotonic relationship but not necessarily linear.\n"
